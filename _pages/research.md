<summary><strong>üí° Large Language Models for Healthcare</strong></summary>

- **Domain-specific post-training & alignment**  
  - Fine-tuning and adapting LLM architectures to specialised clinical tasks and heterogeneous data modalities (text, imaging, biosignals).  
- **Multimodal embeddings**  
  - Fusing wearable time-series (e.g. continuous glucose monitoring, CGM), medical images and narrative notes to enable richer clinical reasoning.  
- **Transparency & trust**  
  - Integrating attention hmaps, counterfactual explanations, and chain-of-thought traces so clinicians can scrutinise model outputs.

<summary><strong>üîç Predictive Modelling </strong></summary>

- **Next-generation architectures**  
  - Temporal Transformers, evidential learning, and meta-learning pipelines for risk prediction, adverse-event detection and beyond.  
- **Personalised vs. population models**  
  - Tailoring shared foundations to individual physiology while maintaining robust cohort-level performance.
